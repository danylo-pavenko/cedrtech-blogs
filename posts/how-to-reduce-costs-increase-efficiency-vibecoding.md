# How to Reduce Costs and Increase Efficiency with VibeCoding

You care about results: getting a working product to market without blowing the budget or the timeline. Too often, “how we’ve always built software” gets in the way. Here’s where the waste usually is—and how a different approach can cut costs and speed things up without sacrificing quality.

## Where traditional development wastes time and money

In a typical setup, a lot of spend and delay comes from how work is organised, not from the idea itself.

- **Long handoffs.** Requirements go to analysts, then to architects, then to developers, then to QA. Each step adds wait time and rework. By the time something is “done,” the business need may have already changed.

- **Overstaffing to compensate for slow cycles.** If one release takes months, the instinct is to add more people. More people mean more meetings, more alignment, more process—and often the same or slower delivery.

- **Building for hypothetical scale.** Teams design for millions of users and edge cases that may never happen. That means more complexity, more code, and more time—all paid for upfront.

- **Rework from late feedback.** When the first real version appears only after a long cycle, you discover what’s wrong (or what’s no longer right) late. Fixing it is expensive. Learning early is cheap; learning late is costly.

The result: higher cost per feature and longer time to value. You’re paying for process and delay as much as for the product.

## What changes with VibeCoding

VibeCoding is a way of building software where experienced engineers work *with* AI tools day to day—not as a gimmick, but as a standard practice. The human stays in charge of decisions and quality; the AI handles a lot of the repetitive and exploratory work. That shifts the economics.

- **Fewer people can deliver more.** One senior engineer, using the right tools and methods, can cover ground that used to need several. You don’t need a large team to get a serious product out.

- **Shorter cycles.** You see working software in weeks instead of quarters. That means faster feedback, fewer “big bang” surprises, and the ability to adjust before too much is set in stone.

- **Less ceremony, more building.** When the team spends less time on boilerplate and manual process, more time goes into features and fixes that actually move the needle.

So you get **fewer processes and more outcomes**: less overhead, less waiting, more value per dollar and per month.

## The numbers we aim for at CedrTech

We work with business owners and product leaders who want to move faster without gambling on quality. With VibeCoding and disciplined use of AI in the development process, we aim for:

- **Roughly 3–5x lower development cost** for the same scope—fewer people, less rework, less time spent on non-value-added steps.
- **Roughly 3–5x faster delivery**—from idea to first working version, and from version to version after that.

That’s not a guarantee for every project, but it’s the kind of result we’re set up to chase: same or better outcomes, with a fraction of the traditional cost and timeline.

## What you should care about as a decision-maker

You don’t need to understand the tech details. What matters:

- **Faster time to market** so you can test ideas and capture opportunities before the window closes.
- **Lower burn** so your budget goes into building and iterating, not into layers of process and delay.
- **A team that delivers**—senior engineers who own outcomes and use modern tools (including AI) to get there without unnecessary overhead.

If that’s what you’re optimising for, VibeCoding at CedrTech is built to support it: fewer processes, more outcomes. We’re happy to show you how that can look for your next product or initiative.
