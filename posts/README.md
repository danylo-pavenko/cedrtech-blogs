# Blog posts

Posts are written in **Markdown** with **YAML frontmatter** so they’re easy to copy-paste into WordPress.

## Format

- **Frontmatter** (between `---`): `title`, `date`, `excerpt`, `keywords` — use these for WordPress title, publish date, excerpt/meta description, and tags/categories as needed.
- **Body**: Standard Markdown (`#` for title, `##` for H2, `###` for H3, bold, lists, etc.). WordPress block editor and many themes accept pasted Markdown; you can also use a Markdown block or convert to HTML before pasting.

## File naming

Use a short, readable slug: `why-vibecoding-perfect-for-startups.md`, `how-we-ship-mvp-in-weeks.md`, etc.

## WordPress workflow

1. Open the `.md` file.
2. Copy the **title** from frontmatter → WordPress title.
3. Copy **excerpt** → Excerpt or meta description.
4. Copy the **body** (from the first `#` heading to the end) → paste into the post body (Markdown or Classic/HTML block).
5. Set **date** and **keywords** (tags/categories) as you prefer.
