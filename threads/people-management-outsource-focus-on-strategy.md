# Delegate People Management So You Can Focus on Strategy

🧵 **Thread: Why you want a fully managed external unit (3 posts)**

**1/3** Internal team stretched. You add external capacity—and end up micromanaging freelancers, chasing status, babysitting. What you need: a unit that *manages itself*. Performance, motivation, retention on the vendor side. You focus on strategy and outcomes, not who showed up or who needs a pep talk. That's people management outsource done right.

**2/3** "Fully managed" = vendor owns it. Performance (goals, feedback, accountability). Motivation and engagement (so they feel part of the product, not "contractors in the corner"). Retention and continuity (no constant re-onboarding). Admin noise (timesheets, leave, equipment) stays with them. You get a *team* that delivers, not a list of people to manage one by one.

**3/3** What you get back: no micromanagement, no babysitting. Mental space for product, market, and how to win. Look for one accountable contact, transparency without overhead, culture fit, and a partner that invests in retention. Delegate people management so you can focus on strategy—and let the rest run without you.
