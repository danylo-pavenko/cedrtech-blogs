# Why IT Augmentation Is Positive for Growth

🧵 **Thread: What the research says about IT/AI augmentation and growth**

**1/3** Augmentation = people + technology, not replacement. McKinsey: future of work is *partnership* between people, agents, and robots; skills evolve, trillions in value by 2030. Harvard (BCG, 758 consultants): with GPT-4, +12.2% tasks, +25.1% faster, +40% quality; "jagged frontier" (AI great on some tasks, not others). MIT/Microsoft (4,867 devs): ~26% more tasks with AI coding assistant; juniors gain the most. Same message: partnership increases output and quality.

**2/3** Exchange of experience: teams that share "where AI helped vs. didn't" improve faster (Centaurs vs. Cyborgs from Harvard). Juniors level up with augmentation (MIT result). Map the frontier: boilerplate/exploration = inside; architecture/product sense = human. Partnership, not replacement. Research + practice align.

**3/3** Why it's good for growth: higher productivity and quality, better use of talent, faster iteration. Sources: McKinsey *Agents, robots and us*; Harvard *Navigating the Jagged Technological Frontier*; SSRN *Effects of Generative AI on High-Skilled Work*. Evidence + your own exchange of experience = augmentation as growth lever.
