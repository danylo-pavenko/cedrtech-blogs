# How to Test Hypotheses Fast and Cheap with VibeCoding

🧵 **Thread: Fail fast, learn faster**

Startups and product teams live or die by how quickly they learn.

The sooner you know whether an idea works, the sooner you can double down or move on.

**Why most ideas don't need perfect code:**

A hypothesis is a belief you haven't proven yet:
- "Users will pay for X"
- "This workflow will reduce churn"
- "This feature will unlock enterprise deals"

You don't prove those with perfect code. You prove them with **evidence**: real people using something, real feedback, real behavior.

**Perfect code is for when you already know you're building the right thing.**

For validation, you need something that works well enough to generate a signal.

**What "fail fast" really means:**

Design your process so you discover failure (or success) as early and cheaply as possible.

- Run a small experiment
- Get a clear result
- If wrong: stop before investing a fortune
- If right: learn in weeks (not quarters)

**The cost of failure is low. The speed of learning is high.**

**How VibeCoding turns "months" into "days":**

Traditional development is slow for validation because everything is set up for the long haul.

For a hypothesis test, that's overkill.

**VibeCoding dramatically shortens the time:**
- From "we have an idea" → "we have something we can test"
- Boilerplate in hours (not days)
- Testable MVP in days (not months)

**Build fast, test fast, discard or scale:**

At CedrTech, our approach:
1. What's the smallest thing we can build?
2. Build it (using VibeCoding)
3. Get it in front of users ASAP
4. Measure what matters
5. Discard or scale

**What you can test in days instead of months:**

✅ Demand for a new feature (landing page + waitlist)
✅ New onboarding flow (build only that flow)
✅ Internal tool (minimal version, one job)
✅ Pricing idea (simple checkout + manual fulfillment)

**Keeping the cost low:**

- Small scope
- Short timeline
- Small team (1–2 senior engineers)
- No huge project kickoff
- No endless refinement

**Bottom line:** More experiments per quarter. More learning per dollar. Fail fast, learn faster.
