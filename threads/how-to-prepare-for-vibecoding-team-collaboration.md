# How to Prepare Your Company for VibeCoding Team Collaboration

🧵 **Thread: Speed requires preparation and capability**

A mid-size SaaS company hired a VibeCoding-first engineering team. Promise: 3–5x faster delivery at 3–5x lower cost. Three months later, progress was slow. Features were half-built. Deadlines were slipping.

What went wrong? The engineers were capable. The technology worked. The problem was on the business side.

**The bottleneck isn't code or technology.** It's clarity and decisions.

## What to prepare:

✅ **Define business outcomes, not feature lists**
- Start with: "Increase user activation by 20%"
- Not: "Build a dashboard"
- Let engineering propose solutions

✅ **Clarify decision ownership**
- Who approves scope changes? Who decides on UX?
- Set approval timelines: "We need feedback within 24 hours"
- Reduce decision layers

✅ **Set measurable delivery targets**
- "Build feature X in 2 weeks" not "as soon as possible"
- Break work into milestones
- Align on what "done" means

✅ **Reduce internal bureaucracy**
- Audit your processes
- Use async communication
- Eliminate unnecessary steps

✅ **Prepare outcome-based documentation**
- Document problems, not solutions
- Keep it lightweight: one-page outcome doc > 50-page spec

✅ **Align expectations on speed**
- VibeCoding = 3–5x faster IF business side is ready
- Set realistic timelines
- Track time from start to delivery

**Speed is a partnership.** Engineering provides capability. Business provides readiness. Both are required.

When preparation meets capability, speed becomes possible.
