# Scale Your Team Without the Pain: Working With the Right Vendor

🧵 **Thread: Scale with a vendor without the drama (3 posts)**

**1/3** You need more hands. Roadmap growing, hiring takes months. So you look at a vendor. Get capacity without recruitment drama. In practice it often goes wrong: slow ramp-up, communication gaps, managing a "partner" instead of shipping. What actually works: one accountable contact, real output in the first two weeks, communication that fits your rituals, flexibility to scale up or down. Treat them like team, not "the vendor."

**2/3** Avoid: partners that sell headcount not outcomes, black-box delivery, rigid one-size-fits-all process. You want visibility (code in your repo, part of your ceremonies), ownership of features, and adaptation to your stack and workflow. Start small. Prove the collaboration on one milestone, then add capacity. Easier to grow a working relationship than fix a broken one at scale.

**3/3** Define success before anyone writes code. "We own feature X, ship by date Y, we're in your repo and standups." That alignment saves months. Scaling with a vendor can be the fastest way to get capacity. The difference is picking a partner built for outcomes, fast integration, and the way you actually work.
