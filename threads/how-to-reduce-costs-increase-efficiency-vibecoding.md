# How to Reduce Costs and Increase Efficiency with VibeCoding

🧵 **Thread: Fewer processes, more outcomes**

You care about results: getting a working product to market without blowing the budget or timeline. Too often, "how we've always built software" gets in the way.

**Where traditional development wastes time and money:**

❌ Long handoffs (requirements → analysts → architects → developers → QA)
❌ Overstaffing to compensate for slow cycles
❌ Building for hypothetical scale (millions of users that may never exist)
❌ Rework from late feedback

**What changes with VibeCoding:**

✅ **Fewer people can deliver more**
- One senior engineer covers ground that used to need several
- You don't need a large team

✅ **Shorter cycles**
- Working software in weeks (not quarters)
- Faster feedback, fewer surprises

✅ **Less ceremony, more building**
- Less time on boilerplate
- More time on features that move the needle

**The numbers at CedrTech:**

🎯 **3–5x lower development cost** for the same scope
🎯 **3–5x faster delivery** from idea to first version

**What you should care about:**

• Faster time to market
• Lower burn rate
• A team that delivers

**Bottom line:** Fewer processes, more outcomes. Less overhead, less waiting, more value per dollar.
