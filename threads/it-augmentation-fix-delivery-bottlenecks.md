Variant 1 (single post)

Hiring senior devs is slow.  
Your roadmap isn’t.  

IT staff augmentation = vetted engineers who plug into your team in weeks, help you hit deadlines and lower total cost—without burning out your core people.  

Reply “AUGMENT” if you want the playbook.

Variant 2 (mini-thread, 3 posts)

1️⃣ Can’t ship on time because you can’t hire fast enough? You’re not alone—global media from McKinsey to BBC all show a structural tech talent gap.  

2️⃣ Instead of waiting 3–6 months per hire, IT staff augmentation lets you add senior engineers, QA and DevOps in weeks, inside your tools and sprint cadence.  

3️⃣ More capacity, lower cost, no burnout.  
Reply “AUGMENT” and we’ll send our framework for fixing delivery bottlenecks in 30 days.
