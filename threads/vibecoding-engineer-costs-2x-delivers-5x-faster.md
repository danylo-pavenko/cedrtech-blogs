excerpt: "Higher hourly rate doesn't mean higher total cost. When a VibeCoding engineer costs 2x per hour but delivers 5x faster, the math flips: you pay less for the project and get it sooner."

# A VibeCoding Engineer Costs 2x More but Delivers 5x Faster

🧵 **Thread: Expensive per hour ≠ expensive for the business**

If you're comparing day rates, a senior VibeCoding engineer looks expensive. Two times a "normal" rate, sometimes more.

**That comparison is misleading.**

What matters: **total cost** and **time to outcome**.

**Why the hourly rate is the wrong thing to optimize:**

"Engineer A is $50/hour, Engineer B is $100/hour—A is cheaper."

Only true if they deliver the same outcome in the same time. They usually don't.

A senior VibeCoding engineer can finish in **one week** what a junior team might take **a month**.

**The math:**

**Scenario 1 – "Cheap" team:**
- Rate: $50/hour
- Time: 400 hours (2.5 months)
- Total: **$20,000** per iteration

**Scenario 2 – VibeCoding engineer:**
- Rate: $100/hour (2x)
- Time: 80 hours (2 weeks) — 5x faster
- Total: **$8,000** per iteration

**Same scope, same iterations:**
- "Cheap" option: $20k, 2.5 months
- VibeCoding: $8k, 2 weeks

**Why VibeCoding engineers cost more per hour:**

✅ Senior experience and judgment
✅ Ability to own features end-to-end
✅ Reduced risk (less likely to leave you with a mess)
✅ Don't need big supporting cast

**Where the "cheap" option gets expensive:**

❌ Delay = lost opportunity
❌ Rework from late feedback
❌ Coordination cost (more meetings, handoffs)

**How CedrTech turns higher rates into savings:**

1. Faster delivery (same scope, fraction of time)
2. Fewer people (1–2 seniors vs large team)
3. Fewer iterations to get it right
4. Clear scope and expectations

**Bottom line:** Expensive per hour ≠ expensive for the business. Often it's the opposite.
