## CedrTech Blogs

CedrTech Blogs is a collection of articles and technical deep-dives from **CedrTech**, an IT Outsourcing / IT Outstaffing company focused on **AI-augmented (“vibe”) coding** for SaaS and other modern software products.

Our goal is to share how **senior engineers + AI** can radically increase delivery speed and quality for fast-growing startups and established enterprises entering the AI era.

### About CedrTech

- **What we do**: Provide **senior software engineers** and tech leaders who are fluent in **AI-assisted development** (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, LLM-based tools, and custom AI workflows).
- **Focus areas**:
  - AI-augmented development workflows
  - SaaS platforms and product engineering
  - System design and scalable architectures
  - Modern frontend/backend stacks
- **Who we help**:
  - **Fast-growth startups** that need to move from idea → production quickly, with a small but very strong team.
  - **Established enterprises** modernizing legacy systems and adopting AI-first development practices.

Our engineers are selected for **strong real-world experience** and the ability to **work independently**, owning outcomes end-to-end while leveraging AI to ship faster and safer.

### What You’ll Find in This Repository

This repo contains **blog posts and technical content** about:

- **AI-oriented development practices**  
  How to design workflows where experienced developers use AI to move faster instead of fighting it.

- **Vibe coding / Pairing with LLMs**  
  Practical patterns for collaborating with AI tools on architecture, coding, debugging, and refactoring.

- **Scaling engineering teams with fewer, stronger people**  
  How to structure teams around senior engineers + AI instead of large junior-heavy teams.

- **Modern SaaS & enterprise rebuilds**  
  Stories, patterns, and reference architectures for:
  - Replatforming legacy systems
  - Introducing AI features into existing products
  - Migrating to more maintainable, scalable stacks

Over time, this repository may also include **code snippets, diagrams, and reference implementations** that support the blog posts.

### Target Audience

- **CTOs / Heads of Engineering** exploring AI-augmented development.
- **Founders and product leaders** who want maximum output from a small, senior team.
- **Senior developers and tech leads** interested in real-world, practical use of AI in day-to-day coding.

### Repository Structure

As the blog grows, you can expect a structure similar to:

- `posts/` – Markdown posts and long-form content
- `assets/` – Images, diagrams, and supporting visuals
- `examples/` – Optional code samples referenced in posts

(If this structure changes, the README will be updated accordingly.)

### About Our Engineering Philosophy

At CedrTech, we believe:

- **Strong seniors + AI > large traditional teams**  
  One experienced engineer with the right AI tooling can often replace a small team of less experienced devs.

- **AI should accelerate, not replace, engineering judgment**  
  We use AI to explore, generate options, and automate repetitive work—while humans remain responsible for architecture, trade-offs, and quality.

- **Legacy doesn’t have to mean slow**  
  Even large, old enterprises can move at a startup-like pace by pairing senior engineers with AI-driven tooling and modern practices.

These blogs are our way of documenting that journey.
